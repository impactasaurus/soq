  "instructions": "There are many ways to try to deal with problems, these items ask what you've been doing to cope. Each item says something about a particular way of coping, to what extent you've been doing what the item says. Don't answer on the basis of whether it seems to be working or not — just whether or not you're doing it. Try to rate each item separately in your mind from the others. Make your answers as true FOR YOU as you can.",
